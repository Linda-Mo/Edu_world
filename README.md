## Inspiration
I wanted to create an app that can influence people in a positive way by providing them with access to materials that can improve their learning journey.

## What it does
is a mobile application that can helps people reach their potential of getting 
and improving their education throughout the world. It is based on offering people education from 
pre-school then primary school followed by university. It offers gaming education for pre-school 
children, then offers study materials and tests for primary and secondary students, finally it offers 
course materials for college and university students. 

Students can have online tutors to teach to them in groups through video calling or they can request for 
One-on-One sessions with the tutors. Students can also ask questions through in-app messaging for
certain topics they want to cover or they do not understand. The app also offers reading materials, 
previous question papers and solutions to prepare for upcoming tests or exams. The app can also keep
track of a studentâ€™s study progress and it has a calendar to allow students make events for tests, 
study sessions, tutor sessions etc.
